# 42Get_next_line
A custom implementation of the C Standard Library `getline` function. Uses static buffer to read from a file. This project is meant to be an add-on to [Libft](https://github.com/ejarvinen/42Libft) project.

## Compilation
`git clone` and `cd` to desired directory. Run `make` in that directory. Running executable `./get_next_line` will display the contents of `textfile.txt` on standard output.
